# GoogleCloudWorkshop
This repo is the HackPack for [VandyHack](https://vandyhacks.org/)'s workshop about using Google Cloud machine learning APIs, adapted from [this notebook](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst/blob/master/CPB100/lab4c/mlapis.ipynb).

## What is Google Cloud?
[Google cloud](https://cloud.google.com/docs/overview) is a platform that provides handy APIs that can run your tasks on virtual machines.

## Before this Workshop
In this workshop, we would work you through building an application using some of the APIs available to us.

Before coming into the workshop, we hope that you have a gmail account. Your school email address would work perfectly. And we would guide you through everything after that!

## Today's project
We would introduce the APIs through building up a project together. 

Suppose you are traveling to a foreign country, where they speak a language that you don't know very well. Suddenly, you saw a sign on the street with no translation, and you are just frustrated and think: "How I hope there's an application that can just translate that for me!" 

So today, we will be building a image recognition application using the following APIs:

* Google Translate API
* Google Cloud Vision API
* Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API

## Get Started
Please use our [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HVPxRWb3HA2-9NvKapEZr2OWg5pGyoe4ZekhRAbehc4/edit#slide=id.g98e001d189_0_10) as a reference for a brief introduction of the APIs and the motivation behind.

And get started through following our [Google Colab notebook](https://github.com/VandyHacks/GoogleCloudWorkshop/blob/master/VandyHacks_GoogleCloudAPIWorkshop.ipynb).
